      <p>
        Many junk foods contain hidden ingredients that can negatively affect your health. These ingredients are often added to improve taste, texture, color, or shelf life, but come with potential health risks.These additives are not always easily understood by the average consumer and are usually buried in long ingredient lists. Some ingredients can cause allergic reactions, disrupt hormones, or increase the risk of chronic diseases. Unfortunately, food companies may use misleading labels or marketing terms like "natural flavors" to mask the use of synthetic chemicals and preservatives.
