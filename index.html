      <h2>Welcome to Our Awareness Campaign</h2>
      <p>
        Junk food is convenient, cheap, and tasty – but it comes with serious health risks. Our mission is to spread awareness about the harmful effects of junk food and promote healthy eating habits for all age groups. Whether you're a student, a parent, or just someone trying to eat better, this website is for you.

      <h2>Why This Project Matters</h2>
      <p>
        In today's fast-paced world, unhealthy eating has become a common habit. Junk food is loaded with sugars, salts, and unhealthy fats that can lead to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and other long-term health problems. This website was created as part of a group project to educate our community and encourage small, meaningful changes in daily food choices.
